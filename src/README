A short review for all the coordinates system in the source codes:
Model coordinates: Defined by the .obj file.

Camera coordinates: (When you look at the image) x: left -> right; y: down -> up; z: outside -> inside. The origin of this camera coordinates lie at the center of the image.

Image coordinates: A 2D coordinates. x: left -> right; y: up -> down. The origin is at the top left corner of the whole image. Example: if the image contains h x w pixels, then the four corners are:
Top left: (0, 0).
Top right: (w, 0).
Lower left: (0, h).
Lower right: (w, h).

Ginput coordinates: coordinates used when we call [x, y] = ginput. This is almost the same as the image coordinates, except that the origin is shifted by (0.5, 0.5). i.e., the origin of the image coordinates is at (0.5, 0.5) in the ginput coordinates. 

Pixel coordinates: A 2D coordinates with only integer values (i, j), where i is the row number and j is the column number. The top left pixel (1, 1) covers the [0, 1) x [0, 1) square in the image coordinates. To access the pixel (i, j), you can call I(i, j) where I is from imread or similar functions.
